__Addition of column required to database__

* This release fixes a long standing issue, DailyTimeIntervalTrigger's time zone is now finally persisted to database
* This requires running [schema_25_to_26_upgrade.sql](https://github.com/quartznet/quartznet/blob/2.x/database/schema_25_to_26_upgrade.sql) to add new column to QRTZ_SIMPROP_TRIGGERS table

A slight performance boost can also be unlocked when using PostgreSQL by switching PostgreSqlDelegate.

__NEW FEATURE__

* Add support for eager validation of job scheduling XML file on plugin start (#492)
* Add support for extra custom time zone resolver function in TimeZoneUtil (#290)
