title : Quartz.NET 3.0 Alpha 3 Released
layout: default

---

This is the third alpha of v3. APIs have had some love in form of adding CancellationToken support and
using more IReadOnlyCollection<T>s more concisely. Unfortunately we still don't have the story done for
remote management support (HTTP API).
  
**When using AdoJobStore: make sure to run both 2.6 and 3.0 SQL migration scripts if you are upgrading from 2.5, otherwise just 3.0 migration script**

__NEW FEATURE__

* support for .NET Standard 2.0 preview (#486)
* support for MySQL on .NET Standard via provider 'MySql' (#493)
* change SQL database IMAGE types to VARBINARY - requires migration schema_26_to_30.sql
* add ISchedulerListener.JobInterrupted(JobKey jobKey, CancellationToken cancellationToken) (#467)

__FIXES__

* fix PosgreSQL db provider configuration for .NET Core (#449)
* CancellationToken is now supported in async methods (#444)
* fix regression with XML schema validation

__BREAKING CHANGES__

* possibly breaking, cron expression validation is now stricter (#315 #485)
* .NET 4.6 required instead of old 4.5
* API methods have been revisited to mainly use IReadOnlyCollection<T>, this hides both HashSet<T>s and List<T>s
* LibLog has been hidden as internal (ILog etc), like it was originally intended to be

__KNOWN ISSUES__

* Issues with time zone ids between Windows and Linux, they use different ids for the same zone
* No remoting support
* Documentation lacking

Check NuGet for pre-release packages.
