[http://www.quartz-scheduler.net](http://www.quartz-scheduler.net)


## Release 3.1.0 beta 2, Jul xx 2020

On the road for 3.1 release, also note beta 1 remarks.

* NEW FEATURES

    * DI configuration now supports adding schdeuler, job and trigger listeners (#877)
    * DI configuration now processes appsettings.json section "Quartz" looking for key value pairs (#877)

    * Ensure NuGet.exe is part of produced zip to ensure build works (#881)
    * JobDataMap with enum values persisted as JSON can now be set back to job members via PropertySettingJobFactory (#770)  

## Release 3.1.0 beta 1, Jul 8 2020

This release concentrates on performance and bringing support to de facto Microsoft libraries like dependency injection and ASP.NET Core hosting.
A big change is that now SQL queries use parametrized scheduler name, which allows database server to reuse query plans and use indexes more optimally.
This will help especially clusters which have large number of nodes. The SQL server indexes were also revisited and their amount reduced by using smarter covering indexes.

There are also some minor bug fixes present.
