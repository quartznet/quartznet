				<title>Quartz.NET 1.0.1 Released</title>
				<p>
				<div class="descr">May 16, 2009 by Marko Lahma</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					Quartz.NET 1.0.1 has been released and it's an advised update for everyone.
				</p>
				<p>
					This release includes bug fixes to issues found in 1.0 release
					and also includes performance optimization to AdoJobStore 
					when Quartz.NET is handling a lot of triggers. Quarz.NET no 
					longer loads all of them but is able limit the query results
					by using a custom SQL delegate. Quartz.NET issues a warning
					on startup if custom delegate is not used. Available delegates
					include ones for SQL Server, Oracle, SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL
					and Firebird.
				</p>

					<a href="http://jira.opensymphony.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10110&amp;styleName=Html&amp;version=21794">release notes</a> 
					and the readme.txt in the release bundle for more information.
