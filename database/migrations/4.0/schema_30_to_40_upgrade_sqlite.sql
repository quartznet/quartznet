-- Quartz.NET schema migration -- 3.x to 4.0
--
-- SQLite only. Run the file matching your database; the other dialects live
-- alongside this one in the same folder.
--
-- STATUS
--   MANDATORY. This is the one migration you cannot skip.
--
--   Quartz.NET 3.x probes for MISFIRE_ORIG_FIRE_TIME, EXECUTION_GROUP, PREFERRED_NODE
--   and PREFERRED_NODE_AUTO at startup and degrades gracefully when they are absent.
--   4.x removed those probes and assumes all four exist, so a 3.x database that never
--   ran the optional migrations will fail against 4.x until this script has run.
--
--   4.x also adds columns and a table 3.x never had -- RETRY_POLICY and RETRY_ATTEMPT
--   on QRTZ_TRIGGERS, and the whole QRTZ_PAUSED_JOB_GRPS table -- and validates its
--   schema at startup, so this script is required even for a 3.x database that took
--   every optional migration going.
--
-- This script supersedes the optional per-feature migrations in ../3.17, ../3.18 and
-- ../3.19 -- it applies everything they do, and it assumes none of them were applied.
-- Run it exactly once, against a database that took none of the optional 3.x column
-- migrations. (../3.20's index alignment is superseded by schema_30_to_40_indexes_sqlite.sql,
-- beside this file.)
--
-- On a partially-migrated database take the stepped route instead -- run the
-- per-feature files you are still missing -- or check PRAGMA table_info(<table>) and
-- apply only the sections whose columns are absent.
--
-- Sections, in order:
--   1. MISFIRE_ORIG_FIRE_TIME column                REQUIRED
--   2. EXECUTION_GROUP columns                      REQUIRED
--   3. PREFERRED_NODE / PREFERRED_NODE_AUTO         REQUIRED
--   4. RETRY_POLICY / RETRY_ATTEMPT                 REQUIRED
--   5. QRTZ_PAUSED_JOB_GRPS table                   REQUIRED
--
-- Every section in this file is safe to run while 3.x nodes are still up, which is why the
-- index set is not in it. That is a second file in this folder --
-- schema_30_to_40_indexes_sqlite.sql -- and it is NOT safe to run during a mixed window:
-- it drops IDX_QRTZ_T_NFT_ST_MISFIRE, which 3.x drives its misfire sweep from and 4.x does
-- not read at all (#3656). Run this file now; run that one once the last 3.x node has shut
-- down, or straight afterwards on an upgrade with nothing running.
--
-- Sections 4 and 5 have no 3.x counterpart at all, so nothing you ran on 3.x can have
-- applied them.
--
-- RETRY_POLICY holds a trigger's retry policy and RETRY_ATTEMPT how many retries of the
-- occurrence being executed have already been made. Both are nullable with no default, so
-- every existing row reads as "no retry policy" and no data migration is needed (#3520).
--
-- 3.x pauses a job group without recording it anywhere, so a paused job group could not be
-- listed or asked about; 4.x keeps the group names in QRTZ_PAUSED_JOB_GRPS, which is what
-- makes JobGroup.Paused answer truthfully and what carries the pause across a restart
-- (#3336).
--
-- Replace 'QRTZ_' with your configured table prefix if different.
-- NOT IDEMPOTENT: SQLite has no conditional DDL, so re-running this fails with a
-- duplicate-column error. Check PRAGMA table_info(<table>) before applying.
--
-- !! FIRST RUN IN TEST ENVIRONMENT AGAINST A COPY OF YOUR PRODUCTION DATABASE !!
