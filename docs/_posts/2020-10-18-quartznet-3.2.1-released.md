title : Quartz.NET 3.2.1 Released
tags : [releases]

This is a maintenance release containing mostly bug fixes.

MS dependency injection job factory configuration was unified and you can now configure relevant options 
like whether to create a separate scope with using just the `UseMicrosoftDependencyInjectionJobFactory` and its callback.
Now scoped jobs also get their properties set from job data map.

Pre-configuring Quartz options from `appsettings.json` with `services.Configure<QuartzOptions>(Configuration.GetSection("Quartz"));`
now also works as expected.
