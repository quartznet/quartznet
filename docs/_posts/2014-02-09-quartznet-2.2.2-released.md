This is a minor release fixing couple of minor bugs.

__FIXES__

* long properties incorrectly read as int in SimplePropertiesTriggerPersistenceDelegateSupport
* RecoveringTriggerKey in JobExecutionContext has group and name wrong way around
* Make SQL Server table create script Azure SQL compliant
* Add missing clustered index for QRTZ_BLOB_TRIGGERS table
** You need to manually add this to existing installation (tables created with old script), see ALTER TABLE [dbo].QRTZ_BLOB_TRIGGERS WITH NOCHECK ADD... in script
