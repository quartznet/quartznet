The whole website has moved to using GitHub pages. It should be now easier to contribute to documentation, the tutorial for version 2.x is currently in the works so stay tuned. You can fork and create pull requests from the [gh-pages branch of the repository](https://github.com/quartznet/quartznet/tree/gh-pages).

There still might be some small glitches with links and content.
