title : Quartz.NET 3.4 Released
layout: default
tags : [releases]
---

This release has Quartz jobs start executing only after application startup completes successfully, unless QuartzHostedServiceOptions are used to specify otherwise.
By default, this prevents jobs from running while the application is still starting, and it alleviates the need to use arbitrary start delays to achieve the effect manually.

Quartz.OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation has been marked obsolete as there's official contrib project on OpenTelemetry project side.

__FIXES__

* Fix for job type loading after version change (#1286)
* Fix StartDelayed delaying the start of other hosted services (#1314)
* Set NextFireTime of the replaced trigger relative to the old trigger's StartTime if the old trigger's PreviousFireTime is null (#1519)
* Include InvertTimeRange property in DailyCalendar.Clone (#1522)
* QuartzHealthCheck never recovers after detecting failure (#1496)
* Microsoft DI integration does not working with Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting v7 preview (#1544)

__BREAKING CHANGES__

* .NET Framework minimum version is 4.6.2 (previously 4.6.1) (#1549)
