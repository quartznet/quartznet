title : Quartz.NET 3.3 Released
tags : [releases]
---
This release addresses problems with using Quartz with .NET Full Framework lower than 4.7.2. ValueTask loading
could fail due the dependencies brought with activity source support. Now activity sources are only supported when
using .NET Framework >= 4.7.2 and netstandard >= 2.0. This also raises requirement the same way for package
Quartz.OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.

This release also improves trigger acquisition performance when using persistent job store, mostly by reducing network round-trips.
The semaphore implementations were also re-written to gain more performance.

Also some bug fixes included, thanks to all contributors!
