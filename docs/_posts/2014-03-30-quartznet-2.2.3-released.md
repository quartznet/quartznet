This is a bug fix release which has some critical fixes, especially for CalendarIntevalTrigger
future date calculation and trigger's next fires not being processed in a timely fashion when AdoJobStore is used
with DisallowConcurrentExecutionAttribute and trigger has short repeat interval.

This update is highly recommended for all users.

__FIXES__

* StdAdoConstants.SqlSelectSchedulerStates does not filter on the SCHED_NAME column
* CalendarIntervalTrigger produces incorrect schedule
* Trigger completion signaling from AdoJobStore does not work properly when DisallowConcurrentExecution is set

__NEW FEATURES__

* IDisposable jobs should be disposed after execution  
* Support for defining DbMetadata via App.config's quartz section
