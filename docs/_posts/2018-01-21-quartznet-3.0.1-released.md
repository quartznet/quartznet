This is a bug fix release that fixes cron expression parsing bug and reverts IRemotableQuartzScheduler
interface back to its original form without Tasks and CancellationTokens - so that's it's actually usable
through .NET Remoting infrastructure. Now zip packing is also back and includes Quartz.Server.

__FIXES__

* Create zip package as part of release, including Quartz.Server (#572)
* A specific CronExpression fails with "Input string was not in a correct format." (#568)
* Cannot use remoting due to Task and CancellationToken signatures (#571)
