## Quartz.NET 3.1 beta 1 Released

The wait is almost over, after more than two years of hiatus, Quartz.NET 3.1 beta 1 is here with exciting new features.

This release concentrates on performance and bringing support to de facto Microsoft libraries like dependency injection and ASP.NET Core hosting.

You can find the revisited packages as:

* [Quartz.Extensions.DependencyInjection](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Quartz.Extensions.DependencyInjection/) - Microsoft DI integration
* [Quartz.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Quartz.AspNetCore) - ASP.NET Core integration

A big change is that now SQL queries use parametrized scheduler name, which allows database server to reuse query plans and use indexes more optimally.
This will help especially clusters which have large number of nodes. The SQL server indexes were also revisited and their amount reduced by using smarter covering indexes.

I would like to thank both Facundo Glaeser and Lewis Zou for working with the new integration packages and their logistics.

The best resouce the see the new DI integration in progress is to head to [the example ASP.NET Core application](https://github.com/quartznet/quartznet/tree/master/src/Quartz.Examples.AspNetCore).

There are also some minor bug fixes present.
