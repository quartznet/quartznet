title : Quartz.NET 3.2.4 Released
tags : [releases]
---

This release is a maintenance release with couple of bug fixes. The most important fix for this release is that
now Quartz distinguishes between external code task cancellation (say `HttpClient`) and job cancellation triggered by using
the Quartz API's `Interrupt` method. Earlier Quartz incorrectly considered also other `OperationCanceledException`s as clean instead of being errors.

## GitHub Issues

__FIXES__

* `JobRunShell` silently handles `OperationCanceledException` which is not correct in terms of job retry handling (#1064)
* Handled exceptions thrown while retrieving the misfired trigger (#1040)
* `FileScanJob` is faling after upgrading from 3.0.7 to 3.2.3 (#1027)
* `JobBuilder.UsingJobData(string key, string value)` should be `JobBuilder.UsingJobData(string key, string? value)` (#1025)
