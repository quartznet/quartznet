This release returns the possibility to resolve jobs from Microsoft DI container. Now container is checked first and if not found then
ActivatorUtilities is used to construct the type with constructor injection support. Now both `AllowDefaultConstructor` and `CreateScope` have
been obsoleted as behavior is now either via DI construction or `ActivatorUtilities` and scope is always created to prevent resource leaks / double disposal.

Also a problem with host name resolution under WSL2 scenario was fixed.

__FIXES__

* Try resolving jobs from service provider before resorting to ActivatorUtilities (#1159)
* Can't get hostname on WSL2+docker host network (#1158)
