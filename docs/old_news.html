													<p>							
		
													<div class="descr" >							
		
								October 2, 2011 by Marko Lahma									</div>						</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					After a long wait there's now a beta 1 release available of Quartz.NET 2.0! 
					This is the first beta version of Quartz.NET 2.0 and corresponds to Java Quartz version 2.1.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					This version is a major overhaul of of Quartz(.NET) 1.x codebase. Now
					code is more unit testing friendly (more interfaces) and API is based
					on generics and .NET 3.5 SP1 features like DateTimeOffset.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
													<strong>							
		
								BREAKING CHANGES									</strong>				
													<ul>							
		
													<li>							
		
								.NET 1.1 and 2.0 support is dropped									</li>				
													<li>							
		
								Quartz.NET now needs .NET version 3.5 SP1 or later to run due to use of new language features and classes									</li>				
													<li>							
		
								Many public interface methods have changed from returning arrays to generic IList or ISet interfaces									</li>				
													<li>							
		
								TriggerBuilder implementations and JobBuilder should now be used to create different job and trigger definitions									</li>				
													<li>							
		
								Introduced IJobDetail, IContrigger, ISimpleTrigger, ICalendarIntervalTrigger have far less members and especially mutators									</li>				
													<li>							
		
								When C5 collections were introduced as set-based implementation provider, ISet and ISortedSet interfaces were narrowed (IList inheritance removed)									</li>				
													<li>							
		
								string triggerName, string triggerGroup are now encapsulated in TriggerKey (has the same fields) 									</li>				
													<li>							
		
								string jobName, string jobGroup are now encapsulated in JobKey (has the same fields)									</li>				
													<li>							
		
								JobInitializationPlugin is now deprecated in favor of XMLSchedulingDataProcessorPlugin, JobInitializationPlugin no longer included									</li>				
													<li>							
		
								Microsoft's Oracle drivers are no longer supported, use 10g or 11g ODP.NET drivers									</li>				
													<li>							
		
								Database schema has changed, you need to convert your 1.x schema to new version, sample migration script available in database folder									</li>						</ul>						</p>				
													<p>							
		
													<strong>							
		
								OTHER NOTABLE CHANGES									</strong>				
													<ul>							
		
													<li>							
		
								XMLSchedulingDataProcessorPlugin uses new XML format that allows more control over triggers but no support for calendars									</li>				
													<li>							
		
								There are extension methods for the new trigger builder that allow you to set trigger specifics									</li>				
													<li>							
		
								Client Profile is now supported and there are now separate DLLs for client profile									</li>				
													<li>							
		
								PropertySettingJobFactory is now the default JobFactory									</li>						</ul>						</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					This version roughly corresponds to Java Quartz's version 2.1.

				  <h2>Quartz.NET 2.0 (vNext) Development Ongoing</h2>
				
													<p>							
		
													<div class="descr" >							
		
								July 27, 2011 by Marko Lahma									</div>						</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					There's been a while since last project news update on the website which seems to have caused some worry on 
					Twitterspehere at least. The discussion has been active on the 							
													<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/quartznet" >							
		
								project mailing list									</a>				
								 though.
					But here's a small recap about what has happened since last official release (1.0.3).
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
													<strong>							
		
								Source code was moved to 							
													<a href="https://github.com/quartznet/quartznet/" >							
		
								GitHub									</a>				
								 12/30/2010									</strong>				
								. 
					It was quite obvious decision to make collaboration and contribution a little bit
					easier than what it has been earlier with Subversion. There has already been a nice set of pull requests, thanks to contributors!
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
													<strong>							
		
								Java Quartz's (when writing in version 2.0.2) development has been ported to .NET side.									</strong>				
								
					All the new features and enhancements are available on GitHub for testing with some .NET special treats, to name a few:
												
													<ul>							
		
													<li>							
		
								Supports now .NET 3.5 SP1 and higher - support for 1.1 and 2.0 was dropped									</li>				
													<li>							
		
								Complete API overhaul, now generic IList interfaces instead of old array based return values, other API improvements									</li>				
													<li>							
		
								Unit testing friendly interfaces like IJobDetail, ITrigger etc, with Fluent Interface based configuration of jobs and triggers									</li>				
													<li>							
		
								Performance improvements, especially for RAMJobStore by utilizing C5 collections									</li>				
													<li>							
		
								New XML job definition format									</li>						</ul>				
								
					There's still things to do, mainly documentation and API cleanup. The code should be safe to use in pre-production, even though some already
					run it in production.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
													<strong>							
		
								When will the next version be release?									</strong>				
								. Short answer: when it's ready. All contributions are important to speed up the work.
					First beta is waiting for good enough migration guide so that's slowing things a bit at the moment.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					In short, Quartz.NET is alive, kicking and progressing! Pull the code from 							
													<a href="https://github.com/quartznet/quartznet/" >							
		
								GitHub									</a>				
								
					and give it a try! As usual, the Quartz.Examples project contains code which was ported from 1.x series to compile and take andvantage of the new API.
													</p>										
																	
		
				  <h2>Quartz.NET 1.0.3 Released</h2>
				
													<p>							
		
													<div class="descr" >							
		
								August 22, 2010 by Marko Lahma									</div>						</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					Quartz.NET 1.0.3 has been released.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					This is a maintenance release with bug fixes for the 1.0 version of Quartz.NET and is an adviced update for all users. 
					This release supports .NET 1.1., 2.0 and 3.5 SP1, there is still no official support for .NET 4.0 but you should have
					no problems running Quartz.NET with .NET 4.0 using the binaries compiled for framework 3.5.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					The Quartz.NET 1.0 maintenance branch will not receive any new features, only bug fixes. 
					Further development efforts will go to Quartz.NET vNext that will have support only for .NET Framework 3.5 and later.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					This version roughly corresponds to Java Quartz's version 1.6.6.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					Please refer to the
												
													<a href="http://jira.opensymphony.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=21840&styleName=Text&projectId=10110" >

				  <h2>Performance advisory for high load database installations</h2>
				
													<p>							
		
													<div class="descr" >							
		
								August 22, 2010 by Marko Lahma									</div>						</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					People running installations with large amount of triggers (thousands) should consider changing their db schema to
					use nvarchar columns instead of the varchar that is the default for Quartz.NET 1.0 db creation scripts. Quartz.NET sends parameters as 
					nvarchar and when used against varchar indexes this will most likely cause index scan instead of better performing index seek.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					In the future Quartz.NET will come with SQL scripts that will create nvarchar columns instead of varchar columns.
													</p>										
																	
		
				  <h2>Quartz.NET 1.0.2 Released</h2>
				
													<p>							
		
													<div class="descr" >							
		
								December 12, 2009 by Marko Lahma									</div>						</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					Quartz.NET 1.0.2 has been released.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					This is a maintenance release for the 1.0 development branch of Quartz.NET an probably also the last release supporting .NET Framework 1.1.
					Further development efforts will go to Quartz.NET 1.2 that no longer supports 1.1 Framework.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					This version corresponds to Java Quartz's version 1.6.6.

								May 16, 2009 by Marko Lahma									</div>						</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					Quartz.NET 1.0.1 has been released and it's an advised update for everyone.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					This release includes bug fixes to issues found in 1.0 release
					and also includes performance optimization to AdoJobStore 
					when Quartz.NET is handling a lot of triggers. Quarz.NET no 
					longer loads all of them but is able limit the query results
					by using a custom SQL delegate. Quartz.NET issues a warning
					on startup if custom delegate is not used. Available delegates
					include ones for SQL Server, Oracle, SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL
					and Firebird.

								November 6, 2008 by Marko Lahma									</div>						</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					I'm happy to announce that Quartz.NET 1.0 Final has been released.

													</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					This release is a bug fix release and also adds the Quartz.NET

					Quartz.NET 1.0 RC 2 has been released. This release is the

													</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					This release contains late minute breaking change. All time
					interval and duration related data that was presented with
					longs or ints before is now presented with TimeSpans which
					is a more natural way for .NET. This change will cause
					compile time errors that should be quite easy to fix using
					TimeSpan.FromXXX methods. Where you earlier had 5000 milliseconds

													<div class="descr" >							
		
								December 1, 2007 by Marko Lahma									</div>						</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					Quartz.NET 0.9 has been released. This is the earlier 0.7
					version renamed to indicate maturity and feature completeness.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					This is again a feature release also containing
					some minor bug fixes. The biggest new features are support for XML
					based configuration for setting up the scheduler and remoting 
					exporting support for the scheduler.
					XML configuration should make it now easier
					to define your scheduling out-of-code regardless of the used job store.
					Remoting functionality allows you to control scheduler over 
					application domain boundaries.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					The Quartz.NET DLL is now also finally signed assembly and
					you can add it to the GAC.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
													<strong>							
		
								
						This release has also major breaking change: all times
						are now expected to be in UTC time zone for Quartz.NET to work
						correctly.
														</strong>

					Please check 							
													<a href="migration_guide.html" >

					Please refer to examples to see XML configuration and remoting
					in action. The documentation is still work in progress.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
													<strong>							
		
								
						UPDATE: XML configuration example's XML file isn't valid
						according to its schema. The "allows-transient-data"
						attribute hsa been removed from the Quartz.NET XML schema
						and can be safely removed from the XML file aswell.

													<p>							
		
								
					Now that version 0.6 was released with quite impressive feature set
					it's a good time to sit back and elaborate a bit what's been up with the project.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					Project has received free license for Clover.NET from kind folks at 							
													<a href="http://www.cenqua.com/" >							
		
								Cenqua									</a>				
								
					(actually now Atlassian - the're cool people too!),
					and did we receive it right on time - product will be discontinued and I believe no 
					further licenses will be given. Cenqua also has opened a 
												
													<a href="http://fisheye3.cenqua.com/browse/quartznet" >							
		
								FishEye view of the source code									</a>				
								.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					The folks at 							
													<a href="http://www.innovasys.com" >							
		
								Innovasys									</a>				
								 also support open source and they gave us a free license
					for their excellent source code documentation management software 							
													<a href="http://www.innovasys.com/products/documentx.asp" >							
		
								Document! X									</a>						</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					So what's going to happen next? We've caught up with Java version 1.6 already quite nicely but there are still a couple of big things to do:
													</p>				
													<ul>							
		
													<li>							
		
								XML based configuration support - ability to define jobs and triggers in XML configuration file									</li>				
													<li>							
		
								Spring.NET support - actually I've already got running code that seems to work but there are still some issues to solve									</li>						</ul>				
													<p>							
		
								
					After XML configuration is working and released (planned for 0.7) it's getting close to 1.0 time. Even though
					Quartz.NET is quite production ready as-is, it'll be considered 1.0 when it's also feature ready.
													</p>				
													<p>							
		
								
					Please remember, It's your feedback that drives this project! So don't hesitate to bring up the the good and the bad
					in Quartz.NET. We gladly accept bug reports (better yet with test code to illustrate and maybe even a patch to fix it!)
					to our 							
													<a href="http://jira.opensymphony.com/browse/QRTZNET" >							
		
								JIRA issue tracker									</a>				
								 and welcome questions and help 
					requests to 							
													<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/quartznet" >							
		
								Quartz.NET mailing list									</a>				
								. It would also be great
					to hear about projects/products using Quartz.NET!

					when having a more frequent firing schedule, like every nth second or minute.

					Now minimal configuration is also automatically loaded from Quartz.NET embedded resource, 
					so if you don't want to change the default configuration, you don't need to type anything anymore.
