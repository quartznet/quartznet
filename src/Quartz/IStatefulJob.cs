	/// <see cref="IStatefulJob" /> instances follow slightly different rules from
	/// regular <see cref="IJob" /> instances. The key difference is that their
	/// associated <see cref="JobDataMap" /> is re-persisted after every
	/// execution of the job, thus preserving state for the next execution. The
	/// other difference is that stateful jobs are not allowed to Execute
	/// concurrently, which means new triggers that occur before the completion of
	/// the <see cref="IJob.Execute" /> method will be delayed.
