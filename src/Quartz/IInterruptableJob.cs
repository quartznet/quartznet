	/// The interface to be implemented by <see cref="IJob" />s that provide a 
	/// mechanism for having their execution interrupted.  It is NOT a requirment
	/// for jobs to implement this interface - in fact, for most people, none of
	/// their jobs will.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <p>
	/// The means of actually interrupting the Job must be implemented within the
	/// <see cref="IJob" /> itself (the <see cref="Interrupt" /> method of this 
	/// interface is simply a means for the scheduler to inform the <see cref="IJob" />
	/// that a request has been made for it to be interrupted). The mechanism that
	/// your jobs use to interrupt themselves might vary between implementations.
	/// However the principle idea in any implementation should be to have the
	/// body of the job's <see cref="IJob.Execute" /> periodically check some flag to
	/// see if an interruption has been requested, and if the flag is set, somehow
	/// abort the performance of the rest of the job's work.  An example of 
	/// interrupting a job can be found in the java source for the  class 
	/// Quartz.Examples.Example7.DumbInterruptableJob.  It is legal to use
	/// some combination of <see cref="Monitor.Wait(object)" /> and <see cref="Monitor.Pulse" /> 
	/// synchronization within <see cref="Thread.Interrupt" /> and <see cref="IJob.Execute" />
	/// in order to have the <see cref="Thread.Interrupt" /> method block until the
	/// <see cref="IJob.Execute" /> signals that it has noticed the set flag.
	/// </p>
	/// 
	/// <p>
	/// If the Job performs some form of blocking I/O or similar functions, you may
	/// want to consider having the <see cref="IJob.Execute" /> method store a
	/// reference to the calling <see cref="Thread" /> as a member variable.  Then the
	/// impplementation of this interfaces <see cref="Thread.Interrupt" /> method can call 
	/// <see cref="Thread.Interrupt" /> on that Thread.   Before attempting this, make
	/// sure that you fully understand what <see cref="Thread.Interrupt" /> 
	/// does and doesn't do.  Also make sure that you clear the Job's member 
	/// reference to the Thread when the Execute(..) method exits (preferrably in a
	/// <see langword="finally" /> block.
