    /// when the jobs take longer to execute that the frequency of the trigger's

    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>
    /// While the example is running, you should note that there are two triggers
    /// with identical schedules, firing identical jobs. The triggers "want" to fire
    /// every 3 seconds, but the jobs take 10 seconds to execute. Therefore, by the
    /// time the jobs complete their execution, the triggers have already "misfired"
    /// (unless the scheduler's "misfire threshold" has been set to more than 7
    /// seconds). You should see that one of the jobs has its misfire instruction
    /// set to <see cref="MisfireInstruction.SimpleTrigger.RescheduleNowWithExistingRepeatCount" />,
    /// which causes it to fire immediately, when the misfire is detected. The other
    /// trigger uses the default "smart policy" misfire instruction, which causes
    /// the trigger to advance to its next fire time (skipping those that it has
    /// missed) - so that it does not refire immediately, but rather at the next
    /// scheduled time.
